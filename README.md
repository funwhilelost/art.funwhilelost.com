## ANSI Art Pack Browser

Built for the Web 1.0 Conference 2015 in Portland, OR.  With the rise of the BBS and ANSI art scene - and [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) - in the 90's there were thousands of art packs shared around the world as ZIP files.  This project allows you to view the contents of those art packs by pulling the ANSI files from Amazon S3 storage and displaying them in the browser as they originally appeared in the terminal at 14.4kbps - using the awesome JavaScript port of the ANSIlove library.
